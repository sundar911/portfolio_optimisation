# Portfolio Optimisation

In this project, I have: <br />
• analysed 5 years (2012-16) worth of stock data for 3 motor stocks - Tesla, Ford and GM <br />
• compared returns, volume traded, amount traded and volatility through visualisations <br />
• built an optimal portfolio comprising of 4 tech stocks based on individual returns, volatility, and Sharpe ratio <br />
• minimised volatility for a given target return using Sequential Least SQuares Programming (SLSQP) to assign an optimal weight to each stock
