# Portfolio Optimisation

In this project I have: <br />
• analysed 5 years worth of data about 3 motor stocks (Tesla, Ford and GM) and compared their returns and volatility through extensive visualisations <br />
• built an optimal portfolio comprising of 4 tech stocks on the basis of returns, volatility, and sharpe ratio
